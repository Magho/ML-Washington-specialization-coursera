    " * Computational cost becomes prohibitive in high dimensions: score calculations have complexity cubic in the number of dimensions M if the Gaussian has a full covariance matrix.\n",
    " * A model with many parameters require more data: observe that a full covariance matrix for an M-dimensional Gaussian will have M(M+1)/2 parameters to fit. With the number of parameters growing roughly as the square of the dimension, it may quickly become impossible to find a sufficient amount of data to make good inferences.\n",
    "\n",

Since there is a small chance for those words to later appear in the cluster, we instead assign a small positive variance (~1e-10). Doing so also prevents numerical overflow.\n",
